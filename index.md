_(At Horseshoe Bend in Arizona)_

I graduated from [Nashville Software School](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) in 2020 and have been working professionally as a Software Engineer specializing in Full Stack web apps using Ruby on Rails.

Outside of work I enjoy being outdoors hikinga and backpacking, studying tech and startups, traveling, and drinking coffee.
