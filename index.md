## About me

![image portrait at Horseshoe Bend](./assets/images/portrait.jpg)
_(At Horseshoe Bend in Arizona)_

I graduated from [Nashville Software School](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) in 2020 and have been working professionally building web applications and services in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, and Spring.

Outside of software I enjoy being outdoors hiking and backpacking, traveling, and drinking coffee and talking about why everyone should try the [AeroPress Go](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-go-travel-coffee-press) (my favorite coffee device).
